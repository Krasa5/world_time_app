# world_time_app

Modified app from The Net Ninja's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ

Major Changes:
- Added all supported locations from the API
- Added Search Bar
- On first init gets user location from IP
- A bunch of other little things
- Most likely coded badly in a hacky sort of way.
